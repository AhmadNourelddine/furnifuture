Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses ReactJs Library for the frontend (https://reactjs.org/). ReactJS is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/) database management program which allows the app to manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
- This project uses Laravel FrameWork for the backend (https://laravel.com/)
- The app uses the font ["poppins"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
